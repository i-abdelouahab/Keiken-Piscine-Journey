## Goal
This code computes the prices of the beverages served in our coffe house.

We'd like you to add an optional cinnamon supplement that costs 0.05â‚¬
to all our existing catalog of beverages.

### Refactoring method used:
To refactor the code, I used the Decorator pattern that allowed me to use composition instead of inheritance.
