## A New Mathematical Model of Mind


## Exactness and Turing Machine

"Exactness" refers to a set of instructions that a computer can follow, which is essential to creating algorithms that work properly. However, this approach only makes sense if we have a clear understanding of what a computer is and how it works. One way to understand this is through the concept of a Turing machine, which is a simple device consisting of a processing unit, a tape divided into squares, and a tape head that can move, read, and write to the tape. The processing unit contains a set of instructions that tell the machine what to do, and different sets of instructions can lead to different behaviors.

Initially, many people were skeptical that such a simple machine could execute any exact sequence of instructions. However, Turing proved that a certain type of Turing machine, now called a "universal Turing machine," was capable of simulating any other Turing machine. This means that, in theory, any computer program can be executed on a Turing machine.

Despite this, current computers still have limitations in practical decision-making in the real world, and it can be difficult to give instructions that involve cultural and language-specific knowledge. Therefore, while the concept of exactness is important, we must also consider the limitations and complexities of real-world applications of computing.

**The brain as Turing Machine**

The idea that the human brain can be modeled as a Turing machine was proposed by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943. They developed a simplified model of the brain consisting of a network of dots and lines, with each dot representing a neuron and each line representing a connection between neurons. The network operated in discrete jumps, with each neuron operating according to "threshold logic," where it would send out all its charge to connected neurons if it exceeded a certain threshold.

McCulloch and Pitts demonstrated that a universal Turing machine could be constructed using this neural network, which means that any computation that can be performed by a computer can also be performed by the brain.

While some neuroscientists have criticized this model as overly simplistic, others argue that it captures a fundamental aspect of brain structure and function. The debate continues, but the concept of the brain as a Turing machine remains an intriguing possibility for understanding the brain's computational power.

## Stochastic computation and Quantum computation

Stochastic computation involves the use of chance along with precise instructions in computing. It is used in situations where randomness is necessary, such as in Monte Carlo methods in numerical analysis. While deterministic functions only rearrange input, stochastic computation allows for innovation through an element of chance.

Quantum computation, on the other hand, is based on the principles of quantum physics and can simulate any finite physical system with a high degree of accuracy. It can simulate both Turing and stochastic Turing machines perfectly, making it a potential candidate for simulating the human brain. However, the concept of "what is a computer" remains elusive and abstract models can only provide partial answers. While there are still problems with the rules of quantum physics, the idea of a quantum Turing machine is a major advance in the field of computation.

Now, I want to take you on a journey to the frontier of computing üòã, where the laws of physics themselves seem to conspire to create machines of unimaginable power and complexity. I'm talking here about quantum computers, the wonder machines that harness the bizarre behavior of tiny particles to perform calculations that would take millennia on a classical computer.

But first, let me ask you a question: what do you think is the biggest number that a classical computer can represent with 64 bits? Any guesses? The answer is 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. That's a huge number, right? Well, let me tell you that a quantum computer with 64 qubits can represent 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 different numbers simultaneously! Yes, you heard me right. Quantum computers can do many things at once, and that's just the beginning of their magic.

So, how do they work? Well, let's start with the basics. Classical computers use bits, which can be either 0 or 1, to represent information and perform operations. Quantum computers, on the other hand, use qubits, which can be in a superposition of 0 and 1, and can be entangled with other qubits to create complex states that classical computers can't even imagine.

Welcome the physics world:

A bit tricky right, well it's a ..... üôÇ

Trust me, you'll be happy at the end,...

Imagine you're playing a game of chess with a friend. In classical computing, you would have to consider every possible move and its consequences before choosing the best one. In quantum computing, you could consider all the possible moves simultaneously, thanks to the superposition and entanglement of qubits, and find the best move much faster. That's just one example of how quantum computers can speed up certain calculations exponentially.

But it's not just about speed. Quantum computers can also solve problems that are impossible for classical computers to solve, such as factoring large numbers into their prime factors, which is the basis of many encryption schemes used in modern communication. This is where the famous Shor's algorithm comes into play, which can factor large numbers much faster than any classical algorithm known to date.

What comes to your mind, when I say Bob, Alice, RSA, the strong RSA encryption right ?

Quantum computation can defeat RSA, so sad üòê

Of course, quantum computers are not perfect, and there are many challenges to building and operating them. They are highly sensitive to their environment and can be easily disturbed by noise, which can cause errors in the calculations. That's why quantum computers need to be isolated from their surroundings and cooled down to near absolute zero to reduce the noise.

But despite these challenges, the potential of quantum computers is too great to ignore. They could revolutionize fields such as cryptography, drug discovery, materials science, and optimization, to name just a few. They could even help us understand the mysteries of the universe, by simulating quantum systems that are too complex for classical computers.

It looks like a rare piece of art, right ? well, actually it is the quantum computer of IBM üôÉ

## Computational Complexity

Computational complexity theory is a field of computer science that deals with the study of the resources (time and space) required to solve computational problems. It seeks to answer questions like "How hard is this problem?" and "How effective is this algorithm at solving this problem?".

The theory is based on the concept of a Turing machine, which is an abstract model of a computer that can simulate any other computer. Turing proved that there is a program that can tell a computer, given appropriate information, how to simulate any other computer. This program can be thought of as a universal Turing machine.

In practice, computers such as PCs, mainframes, and supercomputers are highly flexible and can simulate any other computer. However, the universal simulation program is very complex, and for some problems, it may be more efficient to use a built-in hardware algorithm rather than simulating another computer.

The differences between computers become less significant as the size of the problem increases. This is because the time required to solve a problem instance increases with its size, and any sufficiently powerful computer can simulate any other one. As a result, the ratio of the longest amount of time required by two computers to solve a problem instance of size n goes to 1 as n goes to infinity.

**Simulating another computer ?**

Simulating another computer means creating a program that can mimic the behavior of that computer on a different machine. In the context of Turing machines, any sufficiently powerful computer can simulate any other computer by running a specific program called a "universal Turing machine" that is capable of interpreting and executing any other Turing machine program. This means that if a computer is equipped with enough memory and processing power, it can run the universal Turing machine program and effectively act as any other computer, executing any program that could run on the simulated computer.
