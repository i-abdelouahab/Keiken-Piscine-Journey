## ðŸ“° Introduction

Human beings possess a vast array of abilities, knowledge, and skills that contribute to their unique and diverse experiences. These three elements are closely intertwined and have a significant impact on the human experience. In this article, we will explore the relationship between abilities, knowledge, and skills, drawing on the theory of three-stratum cognitive abilities proposed by John Carroll, and Bloom's Taxonomy, a framework for categorizing educational goals.

## ðŸ“° The Three-Stratum Theory

The three-stratum theory proposes that cognitive abilities can be organized into three levels of hierarchy. The first level of hierarchy includes general cognitive abilities or g-factor, such as fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence. The second level of hierarchy includes specific cognitive abilities, such as memory, reasoning, and spatial visualization. The third level of hierarchy includes specialized cognitive abilities, such as musical ability or artistic ability.

Within these cognitive abilities, there are several factors that can influence an individual's performance. These factors Â as we mentioend include :

Fluid intelligence that refers to the ability to reason and solve novel problems independent of previously acquired knowledge. It is often associated with tasks that require abstract reasoning, such as pattern recognition, problem-solving, and conceptualization. An example of a task that measures fluid intelligence is the Regex Crossword website.

Crystallized intelligence, on the other hand, refers to the knowledge and skills acquired through experience and education, including verbal comprehension, general knowledge, and vocabulary. It is often associated with tasks that require the application of previously learned information, such as reading comprehension and arithmetic reasoning. An example of a task that measures crystallized intelligence is applying knowledge gained from past experiences to solve a problem at work, using vocabulary and grammar rules to write an essay, or using math skills to balance a checkbook.

Working memory that refers to the ability to temporarily hold and manipulate information in the mind to perform a task. It is often associated with tasks that require attention, such as mental arithmetic, reasoning, and language comprehension. An example of a task that measures working memory is remembering a phone number long enough to dial it, following multi-step directions, or mentally calculating a tip while paying a restaurant bill.

And the processing speed that refers to the speed and accuracy with which an individual can perform cognitive tasks. It is often associated with tasks that require quick and automatic processing, such as visual perception and decision-making. An example of a task that measures processing speed is quickly recognizing and responding to a stop sign while driving, reading and comprehending a news article in a short amount of time, or quickly identifying the correct answer on a multiple-choice test

## ðŸ“° What are abilities ?

Abilities refer to the natural or innate aptitude or talent that a person possesses. These abilities are often present from birth and can be physical, cognitive, or emotional in nature. Examples of physical abilities include strength, speed, flexibility, and coordination. Cognitive abilities include problem-solving, reasoning, memory, and creativity. Emotional abilities refer to a person's ability to manage their emotions and understand the emotions of others.

The first level of the three-stratum theory, general cognitive abilities, is related to abilities. General cognitive abilities have a broad impact on many specific cognitive abilities, including abilities related to physical, cognitive, and emotional domains.

## ðŸ“° What is knowledge ?

Knowledge refers to the understanding and awareness that a person has about a particular subject, concept, or idea. It is the accumulation of facts, information, and experience that an individual acquires throughout their life. Knowledge can be gained through formal education, reading, observation, or personal experiences.

The first level of the three-stratum theory, general cognitive abilities, is also related to knowledge. General cognitive abilities can enhance a person's ability to acquire knowledge, understand complex concepts, and make informed decisions.

## ðŸ“° Bloom's Taxonomy

Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for categorizing educational goals. It was developed by Benjamin Bloom and his colleagues in the 1950s and has since become a widely used tool in education. The taxonomy is organized into six levels of cognitive complexity, ranging from lower-order thinking skills to higher-order thinking skills.

The six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy are:

1. Â Remembering: Recalling information from memory
2. Â Understanding: Comprehending the meaning of information
3. Â Applying: Using information in a new or different context
4. Â Analyzing: Breaking down information into its component parts and understanding their relationships
5. Â Evaluating: Making judgments about the value or quality of information
6. Â Creating: Synthesizing information to create something new or original
7. 
Let's examine each stage of learning according to the revised Bloom's Taxonomy, as described in the book A Taxonomy For Learning, Teaching and Assessing by Krahtwohl and Anderson. The authors suggest reading the name of each learning category as if preceded by the phrase "The student is able to..." or "The student learns to..."
![](image%201.png)
The first stage is Remember, where the focus is on memorizing basic facts, such as dates, events, persons, places, concepts, and patterns. At this level, educators might ask learners simple questions, such as what the chemical formula of water is or who the first president of the United States was. The cognitive processes associated with this stage are recognizing, which means locating knowledge in long-term memory, and recalling, which involves retrieving knowledge from long-term memory.

The second stage is Understand, where learners are expected to explain a concept in their own words, describe a mathematical graph, or clarify a metaphor. The cognitive processes associated with understanding are interpreting, exemplifying, classifying, summarizing, inferring, comparing, and explaining.

The third stage is Apply, where learners use learned facts and abstractions in new contexts and particular situations. For example, they might be asked to discuss phenomena described in one scientific paper using terms and concepts of another paper. The cognitive processes corresponding to this stage are executing and implementing.

The fourth stage is Analyze, where learners are expected to break down concepts and examine their relationships. For instance, they might be asked to recognize the genre of a painting or describe the leading causes of the Great Depression. The three particular processes associated with this stage are differentiating, organizing, and attributing.

The fifth stage is Evaluate, where learners are expected to use their knowledge and skills to appraise a situation, justify their stand, or criticize others' opinions. They might be asked to evaluate whether online piracy is ethical or compare a work to the highest standards in its field. The two processes associated with this stage are checking and critiquing.

The final stage is Create, which is the most complex stage of the learning process and the top of the revised Bloom's Taxonomy. At this level, learners combine known patterns, ideas, and facts to create original work or formulate their solution to a problem. They might be asked to compose a song, rewrite a story in another setting, or formulate a hypothesis and propose a way of testing it. The three associated cognitive processes are generating, planning, and producing.

## ðŸ“° Using Bloom's Taxonomy to Evaluate Skills in IT

Before we go ahead, let us introduce skills and competencies which are most important concepts related to abilities and knowledge.

### ðŸ“° What are skills and competencies ?

While abilities and knowledge are important aspects of human cognition, they are not sufficient for success in many fields. Skill and competency are two related concepts that are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings.

Skills are specific learned behaviors that can be demonstrated through performance. They can be developed through practice, training, and experience. For example, programming skills, writing skills, or speaking skills. Skills are often categorized as technical, soft, or transferable skills.

Competencies, on the other hand, are broader and more complex. They refer to a person's ability to apply their skills and knowledge in a variety of contexts to achieve specific goals or outcomes. Competencies are comprised of a set of skills, knowledge, and attitudes that are required to perform a specific job or task effectively. For example, communication competency, problem-solving competency, or leadership competency.

While skills are essential components of competencies, competencies are more comprehensive and include not only technical skills, but also interpersonal skills, communication skills, critical thinking skills, and other abilities that are necessary for success in various fields.

In the field of IT, for example, skills such as coding, data analysis, and troubleshooting are crucial for success. However, competencies such as project management, communication, and teamwork are also critical for success in IT roles.

Using Bloom's Taxonomy, we can evaluate skills and competencies in IT in a more structured way. For example, coding skills can be evaluated using Bloom's Taxonomy to determine whether the individual is at the level of remembering basic programming concepts or whether they can apply those concepts to solve more complex problems. Similarly, project management competencies can be evaluated using Bloom's Taxonomy to determine whether the individual has the ability to analyze project requirements, evaluate risks, and develop effective project plans.

IT professionals require a range of skills, from technical skills such as programming, network management, and database administration, to interpersonal skills such as communication, teamwork, and leadership. Bloom's Taxonomy can be used to assess the level of cognitive complexity required for each skill and identify areas where further training or development may be necessary.

For example, a software developer may need to have strong skills in programming languages such as Java or Python (level 3: Applying), but they may also need to be able to analyze complex data structures (level 4: Analyzing) or evaluate the performance of their software applications (level 5: Evaluating). By using Bloom's Taxonomy to evaluate their skills, the software developer can identify areas where they may need to improve their cognitive functioning to achieve their goals.

In the next section, we will discover together how we can use the taxonomy to evaluate skills concretly.

### ðŸ“° how company can propose meaningful technical skills test to their talent or candidates ?

In today's competitive job market, it is essential for companies to have employees with the necessary skills and knowledge to achieve business objectives. To ensure that they hire the right candidates or provide opportunities for their existing employees to grow and develop, enterprises need to evaluate their skills regularly. One effective way to do this is by administering technical tests that assess specific competencies.

When it comes to evaluating technical skills, the Bloom's Taxonomy can be a useful framework. It categorizes learning objectives into six levels, ranging from basic knowledge recall to creating new ideas and solutions. By using this taxonomy, enterprises can create tests that align with their specific requirements and assess candidates or employees' skills and knowledge effectively.

For instance, let's consider a technical test that evaluates a candidate's proficiency in JavaScript, one of the most in-demand programming languages in the industry. To create the test, we can break down the learning objectives into the six levels of the Bloom's Taxonomy:
