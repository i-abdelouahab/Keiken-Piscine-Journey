## ðŸ“° Abilities in the Domain of Idea Production

### ðŸ“Œ What is an Idea ?

An idea can be expressed in a word, a phrase, a sentence, or indeed any verbal proposition, but it may be something expressed in a gesture, a figure, a drawing, or a particular action. It might be a musical phrase or composition.

### ðŸ“Œ What is divergent production ?

 Divergent production is regarded as being opposed to "convergent production," where the task is highly structured and the problem is only to produce a single "correct" or "best" answer.
 In divergent production, the requirements are relatively unstructured and in which the individual must produce a variety of responses that might meet such requirements.

### ðŸ“Œ How we measure the ability of Idea Production ?

Two main factors works together to generate a diverse set of ideas, evaluate them, and select the best ones for implementation:

1. Fluency: refers to the ability to generate a large number of ideas or solutions to a problem. It involves producing a high quantity of ideas, regardless of their quality. Fluency is important because it allows you to explore a wide range of possibilities and options, and can increase the likelihood of finding novel and useful ideas.
2. Creativity: refers to the ability to produce original and innovative ideas or solutions. It involves thinking outside of the box, connecting seemingly unrelated ideas, and coming up with unique and valuable solutions to problems. Creativity is important because it can lead to breakthrough innovations and improvements in various fields.

### ðŸ“Œ What are First-Order factors ?

First-order factors are the most basic or fundamental factors that contribute to a particular construct or concept. They are the underlying dimensions or components that are necessary to understand the overall concept.

For example, in the field of educational research, academic achievement is a construct that can be broken down into various first-order factors such as intelligence, motivation, study habits, and teacher quality. Each of these factors can be further broken down into more specific components or sub-factors.

### ðŸ“Œ First-Order factors of Idea Production Domain?

In the domain of idea production, there are nine important factors that help us to understand how people come up with ideas. These factors are:

1.  Ideational Fluency: how quickly someone can come up with a lot of different ideas on a specific topic.
2.  Naming Facility: how quickly someone can come up with the name for something when shown a picture or given a clue.
3.  Associational Fluency: how quickly someone can come up with words that are related to a specific topic.
4.  Expressional Fluency: how quickly someone can write sentences or phrases related to a specific topic.
5.  Word Fluency: how quickly someone can come up with words that fit certain criteria (like starting with a certain letter).
6.  Sensitivity to Problems: how quickly someone can come up with solutions to problems or new ways to use objects.
7.  Originality/Creativity: how well someone can come up with unique or unusual ideas.
8.  Figural Fluency: how quickly someone can draw different things related to a specific topic.
9.  Figural Flexibility: how well someone can solve problems related to drawing in different ways.

These factors are important because they help researchers understand the different skills and abilities that people use when coming up with new ideas. By measuring these factors, we can gain insight into how people think and how to improve idea generation.


## ðŸ“° The Three-Stratum Theory

The Three-Stratum Theory is a model used in psychology to describe human cognitive abilities. The theory proposes that there are three levels or strata of cognitive abilities, each building upon the previous one. The first level is general cognitive ability or g-factor, which represents overall intelligence. The second level is comprised of specific cognitive abilities such as verbal, numerical, and spatial abilities. The third level is made up of narrow cognitive abilities, which are specific skills within each of the specific cognitive abilities.


## ðŸ“° Cognitive Abilities

### ðŸ“Œ Fluid intelligence

Refers to the ability to reason and solve novel problems independent of previously acquired knowledge. It is often associated with tasks that require abstract reasoning, such as pattern recognition, problem-solving, and conceptualization. 
>An example of a task that measures fluid intelligence is the Raven's Progressive Matrices.

### ðŸ“Œ Crystallized intelligence

Refers to the knowledge and skills acquired through experience and education, including verbal comprehension, general knowledge, and vocabulary. It is often associated with tasks that require the application of previously learned information, such as reading comprehension and arithmetic reasoning. 
>An example of a task that measures crystallized intelligence is applying knowledge gained from past experiences to solve a problem at work, using vocabulary and grammar rules to write an essay, or using math skills to balance a checkbook.

### ðŸ“Œ Working memory

Refers to the ability to temporarily hold and manipulate information in the mind to perform a task. It is often associated with tasks that require attention, such as mental arithmetic, reasoning, and language comprehension. 
>An example of a task that measures working memory is remembering a phone number long enough to dial it, following multi-step directions, or mentally calculating a tip while paying a restaurant bill...


### ðŸ“Œ Processing speed

Refers to the speed and accuracy with which an individual can perform cognitive tasks. It is often associated with tasks that require quick and automatic processing, such as visual perception and decision-making. 
>An example of a task that measures processing speed is quickly recognizing and responding to a stop sign while driving, reading and comprehending a news article in a short amount of time, or quickly identifying the correct answer on a multiple-choice test..
