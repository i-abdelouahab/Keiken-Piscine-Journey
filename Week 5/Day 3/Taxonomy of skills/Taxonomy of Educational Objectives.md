## 📌 The nature of abilities and skills

* It can be understood as a set of cognitive and practical capacities that enable individuals to perform various tasks or activities effectively. These abilities and skills are developed through a combination of innate talents, education, training, and experience.

* Acquiring knowledge alone is not enough; rather, it is important to be able to apply that knowledge to new situations and problems. This requires the development of intellectual abilities and skills, such as critical thinking, reflective thinking, and problem-solving.

* The operational definition of these abilities and skills is that individuals should be able to find appropriate information and techniques from their previous experience and apply them to new situations. This requires analysis and understanding of the new situation, a background of knowledge or methods that can be readily utilized, and the ability to discern the appropriate relations between previous experience and the new situation.

## 📌 Arts or skills + knowledge = abilities

In the context of education and achievement testing, "arts and skills" refer to the mental processes of organizing and reorganizing material to achieve a particular purpose, while "knowledge" refers to specialized technical information. When these two components are combined, they lead to the development of "intellectual abilities," which involve applying specific technical information to new problem situations. This equation emphasizes the importance of both generalized techniques and specialized knowledge in developing problem-solving abilities.


## 📌 Taxonomy and Skills Management

Skills management is a key element in personal and professional development. To achieve this, it is necessary to use an effective method for evaluating and classifying skills according to their level of complexity. The taxonomy of educational objectives provides a systematic method for classifying skills into different categories.

### What is the taxonomy of educational objectives ?

The taxonomy of educational objectives is a framework that allows educational objectives to be classified according to their level of complexity. It was developed by Benjamin Bloom and his collaborators in the 1950s. The taxonomy consists of six levels of educational objectives, ranging from the simplest to the most complex:

1.  Knowledge: involves recalling information
2.  Comprehension: involves understanding information
3.  Application: involves using information in a new situation
4.  Analysis: involves breaking down information into parts for better understanding
5.  Synthesis: involves combining parts of information to create a new idea
6.  Evaluation: involves judging the importance or validity of information

## 📌 Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy

(from: https://www.valamis.com/hub/blooms-taxonomy)

To provide learners with clearer instructional goals, a group of researchers led by Bloom’s colleague David Krathwohl and one of Bloom’s students, Lorin Anderson, revised the taxonomy in 2001.

![Revised Blooms Taxonomy: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyse, Evaluate, Create.](https://www.valamis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/revised-blooms-taxonomy.jpeg)

In the new variant, nouns were replaced by action verbs. Also, the two highest levels of the taxonomy were swapped. The new learning stages are **Remember**, **Understand**, **Apply**, **Analyze**, **Evaluate** and **Create**. The authors also defined cognitive processes associated with these instructional goals. For example, the ability to remember requires _recognizing_ and _recalling_.

### Bloom’s Taxonomy levels

Let’s take a closer look at each learning stage, based on the book describing the revised framework [A Taxonomy For Learning, Teaching and Assessing](https://www.uky.edu/~rsand1/china2018/texts/Anderson-Krathwohl%20-%20A%20taxonomy%20for%20learning%20teaching%20and%20assessing.pdf) by Krahtwohl and Anderson. The authors recommend reading the name of each learning category as though preceded by the phrase “The student is able to…” or “The student learns to…”

#### 1. Remember

This stage of learning is about memorizing basic facts, dates, events, persons, places, concepts and patterns.

At this level, educators might ask learners simple questions like:

-   What are the most spoken languages of Latin America?
-   What is the chemical formula of water?
-   Who was the first president of the United States?

The associated cognitive processes, as already noted, are:

-   **Recognizing** means locating knowledge in long-term memory related to presented material (e.g., recognizing the dates of important historical events).
-   **Recalling** is retrieving knowledge from long-term memory (e.g., recalling the dates of important historical events).

#### 2. Understand

At this point, learners might be asked to explain a concept in their own words, describe a mathematical graph or clarify a metaphor.

The processes associated with understanding are:

-   **Interpreting** implies changing from one form of representation to another. It might be transforming numerical information into verbal.
-   **Exemplifying** is finding a specific illustration of a concept or principle. It may be giving several examples of Suprematist paintings.
-   **Classifying** is determining a category of something. An example is the classification of mental disorders.
-   **Summarizing** means retrieving a general theme of significant points (e.g., writing a short summary of a story).
-   **Inferring** is drawing a logical conclusion from given information. It may be formulating grammatical principles of a foreign language from the presented examples.
-   **Comparing** is finding correspondences between two ideas or objects (e.g., comparing historical events to their contemporary analogues).
-   **Explaining** is constructing a cause-and-effect model of a system, for example, explaining the causes of the French Revolution.

#### 3. Apply

Now, it’s time to use learned facts and abstractions in new contexts and particular situations.

For example, students might be asked to discuss phenomena described in one scientific paper using terms and concepts of another paper.

The processes of cognition corresponding to this stage are:

-   **Executing** is applying a procedure to a familiar task (e.g., calculating the root of a number).
-   **Implementing** is about applying a procedure to an unfamiliar task (e.g., using Newton’s Second Law in a new situation).

#### 4. Analyze

At this level, students are supposed to break down concepts and examine their relationships.

For instance, they might be asked to recognize the genre of a painting or describe the leading causes of the Great Depression.

The three particular processes associated with this stage are:

-   **Differentiating** means distinguishing important from unimportant parts of presented material (e.g., distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant numbers in a mathematical word problem).
-   **Organizing** involves identifying how elements fit or function within a structure (e.g., finding the hypothesis, method, data and conclusion in a research report).
-   **Attributing** means determining a point of view, bias, values, or intent underlying presented material. An example would be to identify the author’s point of view of an essay.

#### 5. Evaluate

In this stage, learners are expected to use their knowledge and skills to appraise a situation, justify their stand or criticize others’ opinions. They should be able to point out logical fallacies in arguments or compare a work to the highest standards in its field.

They might be asked, for example:

-   In your opinion, is online piracy ethical?
-   Do you consider jazz music to be high art?
-   What are the most absurd arguments against vegetarianism?

Evaluating is divided into checking and critiquing.

-   **Checking** means detecting inconsistencies or fallacies in a process or product. For example, it’s determining if a scientist’s conclusions follow from observed data.
-   **Critiquing** involves finding inconsistencies between a product and external criteria. For instance, it’s judging which of two methods is the best for solving a problem.

#### 6. Create

This is the most complex stage of the learning process and the top of the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy.

At this level, learners combine known patterns, ideas and facts to create original work or formulate their solution to a problem.

They might be asked to compose a song, rewrite a story in another setting or formulate a hypothesis and propose a way of testing it.

The three associated cognitive processes are:

-   **Generating** involves coming up with alternative hypotheses based on criteria. An example might be devising multiple solutions for a social problem.
-   **Planning** is about coming up with a procedure for completing a task (e.g., preparing an outline of an article).
-   **Producing** means inventing a product (e.g., writing a short story that takes place during the American Revolution).

## 📌 Taxonomy of educational objectives in skills management?

The taxonomy of educational objectives can be used in skills management by evaluating the level of skill required for a given position. This can be achieved by using skill assessments based on the taxonomy of educational objectives.

In a business context, the taxonomy can be used to establish skills development plans, by identifying the skills that employees need to develop to achieve the company's objectives. It can also help employers identify skill gaps and develop training programs to fill these gaps.
