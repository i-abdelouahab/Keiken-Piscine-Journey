The word Sprint comes from the world of `Agile`, and it describes a short period of time, typically 1-4 weeks, set aside to accomplish a focused goal.
The design Sprint uses the original concept of the sprint to describe a period of time dedicated to working on the necessary design thinking.

### A design sprint has five phases

- Understand
- Diverge (Mind Blowing)
- Converge (Confirm the choice)
- Prototype (Model of the solution)
- Test

> The above is the timeboxed design cycle

### GOAL

- To get the validation needed.
- To maximize the chances of creating something people want.

### HOW CAN WE MESURATE SUCCESS OF DESIGN SPRINT

- Number of good ideas generated.
- Team alignment.
- Company orientation.

### WHY USE DESIGN SPRINT

- Increase speed
- Increase efficiency
- Increase focus
- Co-creation effect (IKEA Effect)

### Design Sprint for Start-up & Enterprise

In both startup and enterprise contexts, a design sprint can be an effective way to maintain speed while including the necessary research and design thinking. By bringing together a cross-functional team for an intense and focused period of time, a design sprint can help validate ideas and concepts early on, reducing the amount of time and resources spent on ideas that may not be viable.

>For startups, a design sprint can provide valuable customer validation that may be missed in the rush to get a product to market. By focusing on a specific problem or opportunity, a design sprint can help startups quickly develop and test prototypes, gather feedback, and iterate on their ideas.

>For enterprises, a design sprint can help accelerate the product design and development process, enabling them to work more like a fast-moving startup. By compressing the timeline and focusing on rapid experimentation and learning, enterprises can reduce the amount of time and resources spent on product exploration and development.

Ultimately, whether you validate your product or product feature yourself or let the market do it, it's likely that validation will be necessary at some point. By using a design sprint to validate ideas and concepts early on, you can save time and resources in the long run and increase your chances of success.
