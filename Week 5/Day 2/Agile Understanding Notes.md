## What is Scrum ?

Scrum is a popular Agile framework used for managing complex software development projects. Scrum emphasizes self-organizing teams, collaboration, and continuous improvement. The Scrum methodology consists of the following key components:

#### 1.  Scrum Team
The Scrum team is composed of the following roles:
- Product Owner: responsible for managing the product backlog, which is a prioritized list of features or requirements.
- Scrum Master: responsible for facilitating the Scrum process and ensuring that the team follows Agile principles.
- Development Team: responsible for delivering a potentially releasable increment of product at the end of each sprint.

#### 2.  Sprints
Sprints are time-boxed iterations that typically last 2-4 weeks. The Development Team works on a set of features or requirements from the product backlog during each sprint.
    
#### 3.  Product Backlog
The product backlog is a prioritized list of features or requirements that the Product Owner is responsible for managing. The backlog is constantly evolving, with items being added, removed, or reprioritized based on customer feedback or changing requirements.
    
#### 4.  Sprint Planning
At the beginning of each sprint, the Scrum team holds a Sprint Planning meeting to plan the work to be done during the sprint. The Development Team selects items from the product backlog to work on during the sprint and creates a Sprint Goal.
    
#### 5.  Daily Scrum
The Daily Scrum is a short (usually 15 minutes) meeting that the Development Team holds each day to review progress and plan work for the upcoming day. The Scrum Master facilitates the meeting and ensures that it stays focused and productive.
    
#### 6.  Sprint Review
At the end of each sprint, the Scrum team holds a Sprint Review meeting to demonstrate the work completed during the sprint and get feedback from stakeholders.
    
#### 7.  Sprint Retrospective
The Sprint Retrospective is a meeting held at the end of each sprint to reflect on the team's performance during the sprint and identify areas for improvement.
