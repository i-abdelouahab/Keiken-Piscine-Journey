# 🔗 Context

As an Agile team, the first thing to do is to define the project goals, features, and requirements in collaboration with the accounting team, CEO, and legal team. Space industry-specific accounting software may require unique features and workflows, so it is important to involve the Space engineers in the process to ensure that the software aligns with their needs.

The team should also identify any dependencies and external services required for the software development process. For example, if a third-party software provider offers a needed service as an API, the team should ensure that they have access to the API and that it is integrated properly with the software.

As for the Agile roles, the team should have a Product Owner who will represent the stakeholders and be responsible for prioritizing and managing the product backlog. A Scrum Master will be responsible for facilitating the Agile process and ensuring that the team adheres to Agile principles and practices. The development team should consist of skilled developers who are experienced in building complex software systems.

Since the project has a limited budget, the Agile team will need to prioritize features and deliverables based on their importance and value to the stakeholders. They will need to work closely with the accounting team and other stakeholders to ensure that the software meets their needs while staying within budget.

Given that an existing application is currently being used, the Agile team should plan for a smooth transition process that minimizes disruption to the users. They should also ensure that the new software is compliant with IFRS regulations to avoid potential fines.

Throughout the development process, the Agile team should use iterative development and continuous feedback to ensure that the software is meeting the needs of the stakeholders. They should also be prepared to make adjustments and changes as needed based on feedback and changing requirements.

Overall, developing a Space industry-specific accounting software using Agile methodologies requires a collaborative effort between the Agile team, the accounting team, the CEO, the legal team, and the Space engineers. The team will need to prioritize features based on value, stay within budget, ensure compliance with regulations, and provide a smooth transition process for users.

## 📝  What will be a typical Sprint Activities for these teams : A Regular Day, with all the rituals + The special days of the spring ?

A regular day in the Sprint would involve the team participating in the following Agile rituals:

1.  Daily Stand-up: Brief daily check-ins to discuss progress and any issues or blockers that need attention.
    
2.  Sprint Planning: Discuss and prioritize the backlog items for the upcoming sprint, and plan out the sprint goals and tasks.
    
3.  Sprint Review: Evaluate the progress made during the sprint, demonstrate any completed work, and discuss areas for improvement.
    
4.  Sprint Retrospective: Reflect on the sprint and identify what went well, what didn't, and how to improve for the next sprint.
    

In addition to these regular Agile rituals, the team may also have special days during the Sprint that require additional activities. For example, if there is a major release coming up, the team may need to spend extra time testing and ensuring that the software is ready for release. They may also need to work with the accounting team to ensure that the reports generated by the software are compliant with IFRS regulations.

The team may also need to collaborate with the Space engineers to ensure that the software aligns with their needs and requirements. This may involve additional planning and design sessions to ensure that the software is meeting the needs of all stakeholders.


## 📝  What will be the different roles needed in this team? how big should it be?

To develop a Space industry-specific accounting software using Agile methodologies, the team would require several key roles. The roles required will depend on the size and complexity of the project. However, some typical roles that could be required are:
